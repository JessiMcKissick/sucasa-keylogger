## These scripts are provided as-is with no guarantee of quality and only for use as educational tools. 
------
As of the moment the script will work about anywhere with python installed but the injector only works on linux distributions with wget or windows systems with powershell available,
basic script execution possible, etc. 

Assisted injection method coming soon! (Usb loaded with relevant files + rubber ducky combo for systems incapable of pulling data from remotes and the likes.)
